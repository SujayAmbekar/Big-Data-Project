# Big-Data-Project
## Machine Learning with Spark Streaming for Ham-Spam Detection (Enron email classification dataset)

### Batch wise processing using sklearn module and incremental learning.
### Built Gaussian Naïve Bayes, SGD classifier, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, MiniBatchKmeans and PassiveAggressive classifiers.
### Implemented joblib in order to save the trained model.
###vUsed “partial fit” to perform online updates to the model.
